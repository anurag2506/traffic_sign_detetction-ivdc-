<h3> What this project does?</h3>
<p> In the given data set there are 58 labels that include various speed limits and also traffic-signs<br>
    So the given cnn model trains the data in such a way that it identifies the sign<br>
    But the images for each label are in different sizes which calls the need for resize function<br>
    And for easier image detection I have defined the grayscale function.
